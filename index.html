            <p class="description"> As a Programmer at Abinara-1 ITS Robotic Team since February 2022, I have
                been actively involved in researching and competing in autonomous robots for firefighting and rescue
                purposes. I have served as a mentor and speaker at various robotic events, both within and outside of
                Campus. Notably, our team achieved the third place in the Indonesian National Robot Contest in 2022.
                <br>
                <br>

                Since November 2022, I have been working as an AIoT/Software Engineer at Crustea Indonesia, focusing on
                sustainable energy and Internet of Things (IoT) software and hardware. Through my research and
                development efforts, I have successfully created an aerator device that produces nano-sized oxygen
                bubbles for shrimp farmers. This device is equipped with pond quality monitoring sensors that can be
                remotely monitored. Furthermore, I have actively expanded opportunities for shrimp farmers across
                Indonesia, establishing more than five shrimp pond locations throughout Java Island. <br> <br>

                During my tenure as the Head of Website Development Mentor at the SIMETRI Volunteer Program in October
                to November 2022, I led a team of over 20 website development mentors. My responsibilities included
                maintaining teaching materials and organizing the program's activities. Throughout this role, I
                successfully taught website development to more than 80 high school students in Surabaya city. I took
                pride in maintaining high attendance rates of over 80% in every meeting. <br> <br>

                In summary, I am an Information System student at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, driven by a
                strong passion for technology exploration and discovery. With two years of experience in robotic
                research and competitions, as well as one year of experience as an AIoT/Software Engineer, I am eager to
                broaden my horizons and gain international experience.
